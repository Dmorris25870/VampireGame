You, why have you come here? Turn back while you still can.#speaker:??? portrait:Blank
I'm here to stop the Abattoir's experiments on people!#speaker:Hart portrait:Hart
How small minded. In return for these tests, the thralls gain emmense power. Power that could be yours, if you join us.#speaker:??? portrait:Blank
I would never join them. They captured me and my friends! They threw us in a dungeon. My friend is still missing.. Felix.. They must've done something to him..#speaker:Hart portrait:Hart
If they're opened minded, unlike yourself, maybe they gained some power for themself.#speaker:??? portrait:Blank
No they're not like that. They wouldn't!#speaker:Hart portrait:Hart
Typical.. Let me help you with one thing. Your friend is as good is dead. Now get over it and get out of my sight. Patient Zero, take care of this.#speaker:??? portrait:Blank
