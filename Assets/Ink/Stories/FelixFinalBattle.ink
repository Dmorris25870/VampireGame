Player enters room
Z speaks to player from off the screen commending them for defeating patient zero
Player demands Z revelas themselves
Felix walks onto screen and reveals to be Z
Player tries to reason with Felix and get him to join the Mutated
Felix (who has been given power and influence by the Abattoir) believes that the Abattoir is the path to succeeding, because people used to underestimate him in their old lives.
Player says that treating people badly is never the solution
Felix says they can't settle this with words, Power is the only real way to solve this dispute
    -> END
